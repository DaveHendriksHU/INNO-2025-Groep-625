### Agents/

#### household_agent.py
This file defines the ```Household``` class, a ```Mesa Agent``` representing a household unit within the agent-based sustainability simulation. A household contains multiple ```Resident``` agents (created via ```create_residents```) and collectively decides whether to adopt sustainability packages (like solar panels or heat pumps) based on residents‚Äô individual decisions.

Key features and methods:

Attributes:
- **residents:** a list of associated Resident agents.
- **package_installations:** tracks which sustainability packages have been installed.
- **solarpanel_amount, energy_generation, gas_usage, energy_usage, heatpump_usage:** energy-related attributes sampled from config.
- **skip_prev_flags and skip_next_flags:** used for modeling direct social influence from neighboring households.
- **create_residents(nr_residents, id_counter):** Instantiates Resident agents and associates them with this household, inheriting package installation status.
- **calc_avg_decision(package):** Aggregates resident decisions for a given package and installs it if the fraction of approving residents meets the household‚Äôs threshold (household_decision_threshold). Reduces the model's CO‚ÇÇ count accordingly.
- **calc_co2_emissions():** Calculates household CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on electricity and gas usage.
- **step():** Performs a simulation step by calling step() on all residents and re-evaluating household-level package adoption. Also accumulates yearly CO‚ÇÇ savings from installed packages.
- **__str__():** Returns a formatted string summary of the household's ID, package installation statuses, and resident decisions.

This agent is central in modeling group decision-making and environmental impact at the household level within the simulation.

#### resident_agent.py
This file defines the **Resident** class, a **Mesa Agent** that models an individual within a household. Each resident evaluates sustainability packages based on a behavioral decision model incorporating attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. These individual decisions feed into collective household adoption behavior.

Key features and methods:

Attributes:
- **income:** Calculated via a log-normal distribution (calc_salary()), reflecting Dutch income distribution.
attitude, subj_norm, behavioral_control: Core psychological components influencing sustainability decisions.
- **package_decisions:** Stores per-package adoption decisions (True or False).
- **decision_threshold:** Determines the required decision score for adoption.
Modifiers (attitude_mod, subj_norm_mod, behavioral_mod): Adjust each factor's influence on decision-making.
- **calc_salary():** Generates income using a log-normal distribution based on config parameters (median_income, sigma_normal).
- **calc_behavioral_control():** Calculates per-package feasibility based on resident income and household context via the package's own behavioral influence function.
- **calc_subjective_norm():** Retrieves or updates perceived social pressure per package from the environment or previous state.
- **calc_decision():** Computes a decision score for each not-yet-adopted sustainability package using:
```
decision_stat = (attitude * mod + subjective_norm * mod + behavioral_control * mod) / 6
```
If this score exceeds the decision_threshold, the resident adopts the package.
- **collect_resident_data():** Gathers internal state data (e.g., income, attitude, adoption decisions) into a dictionary for logging or analysis.
- **step():** Simulation step logic. Triggers decision-making (calc_decision()), applies a random raise to income, and re-evaluates behavioral control and norms.
This agent models the micro-level dynamics of sustainability decisions, supporting the simulation‚Äôs broader goal of understanding household and community adoption patterns.

### AgentLLMHandler.py

This module defines the AgentLLMHandler class, responsible for managing conversations between a resident agent and a local LLM (e.g., via Ollama). It handles prompt generation, conversation memory, and reading/writing data to JSON for persistence across simulation steps.

**Class:** AgentLLMHandler
Handles communication with a language model for simulating resident opinions on sustainability.

**Constructor**
```
def __init__(self, model_name, chosen_config)
```
- Initializes model name and config.
- Sets up file path for conversation data (auto-increments per run).
- Prepares cache variables and state flags.

**Key Methods**
**Agent ID & File Setup**
- **set_current_agent_id(agent_id):** Sets which resident is currently being queried.
- **_get_json_file_name():** Generates a file name like simulation_data_001.json, creating the data folder if needed.

**JSON Caching & Saving**
- **_load_json():** Loads JSON once and caches it to reduce disk reads.
- **_save_json():** Writes back only if _data_dirty flag is True.

**Conversation Management**
- **get_agent_conversation():** Loads the existing chat history for the current agent.
- **update_agent_conversation():** Updates the JSON if the current conversation has changed.

**Prompt Generation**
- **_get_system_prompt():** Returns a static system prompt with current values for attitude, norms, and control.
- **_get_system_prompt_second_version(max_years=5):** Builds a time-series-based prompt using historic simulation values per year for the current agent. Returns fallback if no data available.

**Conversation Initialization**
```
def _init_conversation(agent_id)
```
- Loads past history for a given agent or initializes a new conversation using a system prompt (preferably with historic data).

**Chat with the LLM**
```
def chat(agent_id, prompt)
```
- Initializes conversation if necessary.

- Appends the user prompt and sends it to the model using ollama.chat(...).

- Receives the assistant's response, stores it, and updates the JSON data.

**Behavior Summary**
- Uses structured JSON files to store:
- - Per-agent conversation history.
- - Yearly simulation data (attitude, norms, control).
- Adjusts prompts dynamically based on agent history.
- Allows querying an LLM to simulate nuanced agent responses.

This class enables more human-like simulation of resident behavior by interfacing simulation data with a local language model and managing persistent memory per agent.
